    <h5 class="rootCauseOrange">ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS NOW THROUGH TUESDAY, JULY 15, 2014</h5>

    <p>
        Root Cause believes that social innovation is critical to ensure that our public and private resources are leveraged in the most effective ways to address our nation’s social problems.
        Yet, it is often difficult for emerging innovations to receive the recognition and support they need to develop and spread their impact.
        <strong>Root Cause’s Social Innovation Forum provides a unique opportunity for innovative nonprofits and social enterprises to gain visibility, expand their networks, and build capacity.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        For our 2014–2015 program, we will select one nonprofit Social Innovator for each of our six <a href="http://www.rootcause.org/sif-social-issue-tracks">“social issue tracks.”</a>
        A second accelerator with its own unique application process and timeline, called “Impact Investing: Connecting Social Enterprises to Capital,” will engage a small cohort of social enterprises.
        This accelerator will launch in late July. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.rootcause.org/sif-become-an-impact-entrepreneur">www.rootcause.org/sif-become-an-impact-entrepreneur</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        First-round applications for the six nonprofit social issue tracks are now closed. Those invited to submit second-round applications should select their social issue track under "Apply" and complete the second-round application by Thursday, August 28. If you are a social enterprise applying for the Impact Investing Accelerator, please select "Impact Investing Accelerator" under the "Apply" drop-down menu. Impact Investing applicants must submit their applications by Wednesday, October 1.
